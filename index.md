# Welcome to Machine Learning Bits and Stuff  


Hi! I'm **Victor**, and this blog is where I explore and learn about **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and AI**.  

I'm deeply passionate about **AI for Science**, particularly its applications in **chemistry**â€”from **protein modeling** to **ligand generation** and beyond.
